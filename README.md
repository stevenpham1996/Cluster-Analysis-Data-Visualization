# Cluster Analysis and Data Visualization w/ K-Nearest Neighbors &amp; Plotly Express
This is one of the project tasks of the @GRIP Internship Program from The Spark Foundation

## Objective:
Given the 'Iris' dataset of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor):
- Finding the optimal number of clusters that accurately represents the speccies.
- Create visual demostration of the research.

## Approach:
- Use the `KMeans` algorithm from `sklearns` to defind the clusters.
- Use the `Plotly Express` library for data visualization.

### Dataset:
